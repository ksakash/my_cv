1. torpedo contains a problem od handling two contours so there is a problem that when bot comes near the torpedo then it sees only one contour so code must decide which contour to take for claculating the distance from the torpedo.

2. if bot is near the torpedo only one contour is there.

3. take he average of the largest and the second largest contour and then use the side of the square to calculate the distance. 

4. when the second_largest_area is zero then the side to be taken to calculate the distance will be the largest_area side.
